Starting my Calculator miniproject.
1 - added functions 'add', 'sub', multi and div into .js file.
2 - created function 'consoleResult' to print all results in console.
3 - created buttons in html.
4 - created different collors for different buttons (numbers vs functions)
5 - added function 'handleEventClick' which read value after mouse click
